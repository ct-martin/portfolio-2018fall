Showcasing the projects, articles, & talks I've worked on.

This codebase creates a static Single-Page App (SPA), built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), a framework built on the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) ecosystem. The front-end uses [Buefy](https://bulma.io/), a Vue implementation of the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework, and [vue-awesome-swiper](https://surmon-china.github.io/vue-awesome-swiper/), a Vue implementation of [swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper). Google's document viewer is used for viewing PDFs, and Cloudflare & GitHub Pages are used for convenient hosting.

I'm using the Vue ecosystem because I find it easier to work with than React. For example, I don't have to worry about using `className` instead of `class` and `.vue` component/page files let you use a `<template>` tag to enclose your DOM elements.
