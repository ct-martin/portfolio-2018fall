      I'm currently using <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/" target="_blank">Gitea</a> for my Git forge.
      I'm trying to migrate to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, but I've had a lot of issues setting it up.
      I <a href="https://blog.ctmartin.me/2019/02/ci-cd-with-gitlab/" target="_blank">wrote recently about using GitLab CI/CD</a> and am working on a local runner.

    <p>
      All Git data is stored on my NAS' encrypted volume.
      This is probably overkill for the projects I'm doing, but it works and that volume is redundant so there's some safety in doing that.
