    <p>
      Since joining the project, TigerOS has re-written almost all of its codebase.
      We've changed a lot of things to ensure compatibility with upstream Fedora, RIT's networking &amp; labs, and software users might be coming from.
      We've also refactored the packages to ensure better updating and forward compatibility.
